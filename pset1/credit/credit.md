# Credit
## Getting Started

Click inside of that terminal window and then execute

``
wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2021/fall/psets/1/credit.zip
``

followed by Enter in order to download a ZIP called credit.zip in your codespace. Take care not to overlook the space between wget and the following URL, or any other character for that matter!

Now execute

``
unzip credit.zip
``

to create a folder called credit. You no longer need the ZIP file, so you can execute

``
rm credit.zip
``

and respond with “y” followed by Enter at the prompt to remove the ZIP file you downloaded.

Now type

``
cd credit
``

followed by Enter to move yourself into (i.e., open) that directory. Your prompt should now resemble the below.

``
credit/ $
``

If all was successful, you should execute

``
ls
``

and see a file named credit.c. Executing code credit.c should open the file where you will type your code for this problem set. If not, retrace your steps and see if you can determine where you went wrong!
